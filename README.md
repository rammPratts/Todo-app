# Todo-app
Todo-App made with NodeJs

This project is part of [The Complete Node.js Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/) made by [Andrew Mead](https://www.udemy.com/user/andrewmead/).
The code was written while watching the course, creating a full API with testing.

## Features
This is a simple To-do api. You can create, get, delete and update your To-dos, which will be saved in a MongoDB database. In order to create and get todos, you have to create a user, as the api requires authentication.
Postman is recommended to try the api.
